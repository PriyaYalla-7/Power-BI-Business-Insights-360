 ## Problem Statement

AtliQ Hardware has become one of the fastest growing companies in the electronic goods. Despite experiencing substantial growth in recent 
years, the company faced a significant setback in Latin America when a newly opened store resulted in substantial losses. 

This setback was attributed to the company's reliance solely on surveys and institutional data for decision-making. Consequently, during the annual strategic meeting, it was decided to implement data analytics within the organization to drive data-driven decision-making. Recognizing the limitations of Excel files, especially given the company's size and complexity, there was a need for a more robust solution to bring transparency to the data and enable accurate decision-making. 

**My course of action:** &nbsp;Taking the initiative as a data enthusiast, I spearheaded the development of reports using the powerfulÂ toolÂ PowerÂ BI.

## Holistic Summary

I created a Power BI dashboard comprising Finance, Sales, Marketing, Supply Chain, and Executive Views. 

### 1) Finance View

In our finance view, we analyze Profit and Loss (P&L) statements, visualize net sales performance, and breakdown top and bottom products and customers across markets, products, and customers. This view serves as a tool to monitor financial performance, pinpoint cost-saving opportunities, mitigate financial risks, and ensure regulatoryÂ compliance.
### 2) Sales View

In our Sales View, we analyze the performance of both customers and products across various markets, regions, and segments. Additionally, we utilize a Net Sales and Gross Margin Percentage Matrix. This view is dedicated to activities involved in selling products to customers and fostering customer relationships. It serves as a tool to track sales opportunities, achieve revenue targets, monitor sales progress, and nurture leadsÂ effectively.
### 3) Marketing View

In our Marketing View, we analyze both product and customer/market performance, along with a matrix showcasing net sales against net profit percentage and gross margin percentage. This view is essential for understanding customer needs, evaluating marketing effectiveness, and devising strategies to enhance marketing efforts. It serves as a valuable tool for driving customer engagement and fosteringÂ loyalty.
### 4) Supplychain View

Within our Supply Chain View, we delve into key metrics such as Forecast Accuracy Percentage, Net Error, Net Error Percentage, and Risk. Additionally, we analyze Net Sales Performance Over Time and identify Top or Bottom Products and Customers by Net Sales. This comprehensive view serves as a cornerstone for process optimization, cost reduction, supplier relationship management, and the overall enhancement of supply chainÂ efficiency.
### 5) Executive View

The Executive View provides a high-level summary of key performance indicators (KPIs) crucial for assessing overall business performance. This view serves as a strategic tool to identify growth opportunities, allocate resources effectively, and guide the organization's strategicÂ direction.
